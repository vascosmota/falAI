Speech-to-text tool


## Use Case
Creating emails by speaking to a microphone.

The tool could be a plugin to an email application. The input will be the speach streamed from the user microphone.

The vision is that the user dictates the email to the microphone and the tool renders the text in real-time for the user to see. 

In a more advanced state, it could include additional commands to deal with mistakes during the translation, or even when the user decides to rephrase something.

## Speech to text rendering
A pre-trained AI model will tranform the speech (in European Portuguese) to text (in European Portuguese).

## PoC
1. Create a text file with spoken word.
2. Create a text file with spoken word from the user's microphone
3. Realtime rendering of the spoken word from the user's microphone.
